	<h3 class="brief-h3">Part 2: Portfolio website</h3>
	<p>Turning theory into practice you are to assemble your ‘Codepens’ into a ‘Resource’ website. Use appropriate JavaScript and
	jQuery enhancements to showcase your coding proficiency and use a combination of js and advanced css to create
	an effective and engaging website. As well as pages for showcasing your ‘Codepens’, you will create an ‘about this site’
	page/section explaining the project and how you built your site and an ‘author’ page/section to give information about
	yourself”.</p>
	<p>This can be a single or multi-page site, whatever suits your intended experience you want to create.
	The goal of this project is to produce something that you can add to your CV as a representation of your JS coding skills.</p>
